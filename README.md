## websocket_chat_3

* I figured out a way to get username from query in href of window.

* This version of project 1 should be pretty close to ready state to check in.

* A screenshot "username msg-container onlineCount" is uploaded to the repo.

* When a user clicks CLOSE or [x] of a browser tab to leave the chat room, it will show a message like "David: offline" to rest online clients.

* Can you help check why enterChatRoom() does not seem to work? I try to show "Molly: online" when a new user enters the chat room.

* Please advise on items to fix or improve further. Thank you!
